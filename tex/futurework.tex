{\small
\begin{itemize}
\item investigate structural mechanism for observed differences in response to mutation 
\begin{itemize}
\item assess phenotypic outcomes of combined pairs of mutations  
\item assess skeletonized genotypes as graphs
\end{itemize}
\item investigate capacity of individuals evolved under different regimes to switch objectives
\item replicate results with more sophisticated model
\end{itemize}
